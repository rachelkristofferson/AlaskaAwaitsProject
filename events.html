                At Alaska Awaits, we are connected with vendors and event 
                coordinators throughout the entire state of Alaska. We have 
                an event for you, from bustling Juneau city life to the 
                remote fishing villages not found on any map. Alaska Awaits 
                has researched for you and filled out the calendar with 
                events year-round with something happening at least once a 
                month. If your vacation is in the middle of winter, we will 
                still have an event for you sponsored by us or one of our 
                many partners. <br>Alaska Awaits!
